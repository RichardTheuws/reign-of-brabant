# Changelog

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Music Integration System**: Dynamic battle intensity music (3 levels), faction themes (Brabanders/Randstad/Limburgers/Belgen), menu music, victory/defeat stingers, boss battle theme, crossfade transitions
- **Wood as 2nd resource**: Tree resource nodes on map, Lumber Camp building (Houtzagerij), workers gather wood from trees, HUD shows wood count
- **Tech Tree & Upgrades**: Blacksmith building with 7 researches — Zwaardvechten I/II, Boogschieten I/II, Bepantsering I/II, Snelle Mars I. Prerequisites, progress bars, retroactive application to existing units
- **Campaign missions 7-9**: "De Markt van Brabant" (economy+defense), "Het Beleg van Eindhansen" (siege warfare), "De Brabantse Nansen" (epic 2-front finale with CEO boss wave)
- **10 Suno music tracks**: Main menu, 4 faction themes, battle low/high, victory, defeat, boss battle

### Fixed
- **HERO_ARCHETYPES null check**: hero-died/hero-revived events now guard against invalid heroTypeId preventing potential crash
- **Defeat track trimmed**: 3:31 → 1:10 with fade-out (appropriate length for defeat stinger)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Double Y-offset on buildings**: `syncRenderPositions` no longer positions buildings (was fighting with `BuildingRenderer.update`). Buildings now exclusively positioned by their renderer with correct per-model offset.
- **Movement Y-jitter**: Units now lerp to terrain height (`dt * 12` rate) instead of snapping, eliminating vertical stutter on micro-bumps.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: `destroy-building` objective now counts ALL destroyed enemy buildings, not just TownHalls. Fixes Mission 4 bonus objective "Vernietig de 2 bevoorradingsdepots" which was impossible to complete.
- **Division by zero guard**: MovementSystem uses `Math.max(_dist, 0.001)` to prevent NaN propagation if unit spawns exactly on target position.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Campaign missions 4-6**: "De Binnendieze" (stealth commando), "Heuvelland Diplomatie" (survive Limburgse tests), "De Boerenopstand" (free tractors, destroy garrison)
- **51 ElevenLabs voice lines**: Per-unit-type voices for Boer (calm farmer), Carnavalvierder (euphoric party animal), Kansen (whispery stealth) + Randstad generics
- **Voice line integration**: `playUnitVoice()` triggered on select, move, attack, gather with unit-type-specific personality
- **Per-unit voice settings**: Different ElevenLabs stability/style per unit type for distinct personalities
- **Failed path tracking**: Voice system silently skips missing audio files without console spam

### Changed
- **UnitVoices.ts refactored**: From flat faction-only to `faction/unitType/action_n.mp3` hierarchy with fallback to generic
- **Building Y-offset**: v02 models lifted +0.6, v01 +0.3 to prevent sinking into terrain
- **Building update loop**: Consistent Y-offset applied via `userData.buildingYOffset` during frame updates

### Fixed
- **Building sinking**: Town Hall and Barracks no longer clip into terrain on hilly maps

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Post-processing pipeline**: EffectComposer with bloom (strength 0.3, threshold 0.85) and green selection outlines (OutlinePass)
- **Procedural walk animation**: Units bob, sway, and lean forward when moving, with smooth idle-to-walk transitions
- **Meshy v6 model generation script**: `scripts/generate_v6_models.sh` — image-to-3D using concept art references, production quality
- **v02 model set**: New Meshy v6 production models replacing v2 preview blobs (in progress)

### Changed
- Minimap now renders with proper terrain cache, fog of war overlay, faction-colored units, and camera viewport indicator
- HUD minimap data interface exported for type-safe updates

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Sky dome**: Procedural gradient sky (deep blue → sky blue → golden horizon haze)
- **Atmospheric fog**: Exponential fog for depth and distance haze
- **Shadow mapping**: PCFSoft shadows from sun light (2048x2048 shadow map)
- **Dust particles**: 200 floating golden dust motes for atmosphere
- **Particle effects system**: 500-particle pool with 5 effect types:
  - Gold sparkle on resource deposit
  - Construction dust on building placement
  - Combat hit sparks (melee red/orange, ranged blue/white)
  - Death effect with faction-colored smoke
  - Ability burst ring (carnavalsrage orange ring)
- **Ambient audio**: Birds and wind loops auto-start on game init

### Changed
- **Terrain**: MeshStandardMaterial (was Lambert), richer 9-color palette with ±10% micro-variation, max height 5 (was 3), receiveShadow enabled
- **Water**: MeshStandardMaterial with roughness 0.2, metalness 0.3, reflections
- **Units**: 1.5x scale, shadow casting, larger blob shadows (1.2 radius), red damage flash, bigger idle bob (0.08), larger move indicators
- **Buildings**: 1.8x scale, shadow casting, larger production gear indicator
- **Props**: Trees 1.5x scale, rocks 1.3x scale, shadow casting on all
- **Selection circles**: 1.5x scale, health bars 2.0x0.3 (was 1.5x0.2), Y offset 2.5 (was 1.8)
- **HUD**: Always-visible resource bar (gold/pop/gezelligheid), restyled minimap (180x180, gold border), command panel bottom-center with 44px buttons, selection panel bottom-right, slide-in alert toasts, polished game-over screen

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Duplicate event listeners for `unit-trained` and `unit-died` — both `_setupMissionEvents()` and `setupEventListeners()` registered handlers, causing double audio, double mesh creation, and double stat tracking
- **CRITICAL**: Event listener accumulation between missions — canvas click/mouseup/mousemove and window keydown listeners were never removed, causing input lag and memory leaks on replay
- **CRITICAL**: No ECS world reset between missions — dead entities from previous missions persisted in bitECS world, degrading performance
- **WARNING**: HUD listener accumulation — `initHUD()` created new HUD instances without destroying the old one
- Dead imports removed: `IsSummon`, `getHeroTypesForFaction`, `resetHeroTracking`, `setAbilityTarget`, `getPendingRevivals` (Game.ts), `audioManager` (GameStates.ts)

### Added
- `cleanup()` method on Game class — properly tears down event listeners, EventBus, HUD, entity meshes, and ECS world between games/missions
- `addTrackedListener()` helper for automatic canvas/window listener tracking and removal
- Idempotency guards on `setupInput()` and `setupEventListeners()` to prevent double registration

### Changed
- `initMission()` now calls `cleanup()` before re-initializing, ensuring clean state
- `initMission()` reformatted from compressed one-liners to readable multi-line code

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Initial release: 2 playable factions, 4 heroes, 3 campaign missions
- Three.js rendering, bitECS ECS, recast-navigation pathfinding
- Fog of War, minimap, tutorial, main menu
- 15 SFX (ElevenLabs), 12 Meshy 3D models
